GenCorPrediction
================

Description
-----------

Project repository for efforts to predict the genetic correlation in bi-parental population and validate these predictions.

Objectives
----------

The objectives of this project are to:

1.  Predict the genetic correlation in bi-parental populations and validate these predictions using empirical data.
2.  Use simulations to identify the factors that influence the prediction accuracy of genetic correlation.
3.  Use simulations to assess the response to selection of two genetically correlated traits when selecting parent combinations based on predicted genetic correlation.
